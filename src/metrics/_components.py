"""
Components are what metrics are computed on.

A component is a single layer, group of layers, activations etc, the choice is arbitrary,
as long as the given metric defines how to compute the metric for the component.

In this file, we define common complex components (e.g. the OV-Circuit) that can be used to
compute more advanced metrics.
